## Introduction
- Unix design principles is the employment of separate processes to control distinct functions of the system.
- These processes are called daemons.
- Daemons are also responsible for extended features underlying the operating system:
	- Network application services: HTTP server, file sharing, email, etc
	- databases
	- on-demand configuration
- Linux utilizes a monolithic kernel, many low level aspects of the operating system are affected by daemons like load balancing and firewall configuration.

- Which daemons should be active depends on the purpose of the system.
- The set of active daemons should also be modifiable at runtime.
- Every major Linux distribution offers some form of service management utility to control the system.

- The first method is implemented by the **SysVinit** (System V or just SysV)
- The second method is implemented by systemd and Upstart.
- The service manager is the first program launched by the kernel during the boot process, so its PID is always 1.

### SysVinit

A service manager based on the Sysvinit standard will provide predefined sets of syste states, called runlevels.

- Runlevel 0: shutdown
- Runlevel 1, s or single: without network, maintenance mode.
- Runlevel 2,3,4: multi-user mode. Users can log in by console or network. Runlevels 2 and 4 are not often used.
- Runlevel 5: Multi-user model. It's equivalent to 3 + graphical model login
- Runlevel 6: System restart.

The program responsible for managing runlevels and associated daemons/resources is `/sbin/init`
- `init` identifies the requested runlevel, defined by a kernel parameter or in the `/etc/inittab` file and loads the associated scripts listed there for the given runlevel.
- Every runlevel may have many associated service files, usually scripts in the `/etc/init.d/`
- THe syntax of `//etc/inittab`
```
id:runlevels:action:process
```
- id is a generic name up to 4 chars, used to identify the entry
- runlevels entry is a list of runlevel numbers for which a specified action should be executed.
- Action defines how init will execute the process indicated by the term process

Available actions:
1. boot: :process will be executed during system initialization
2. bootwait: :process will be executed during ssystem initialization and initi will wait until it finishes.
3. sysinit: :Process will be executed after system initialization.
4. wait: :Process will be executed for the give runlevels
5. respawn: :Process will be restarted if it is terminated
6. ctrlaltdel :Process will be executed when the init process receives the `SIGINT` signal. Trigerred when Ctrl + Alt + Del.

### Systemd

Set of tools to manage system resources and services.
Units.
The unit for httpd server process (like the Apache web server) will be `httpd.service` and its configuration file will also be called httpd.service (On Debian based distribution this units is named apache2.service)

7 distinct types of `systemd units`:
1. service: the most common unit type, for active system resources that can be initiated, interrupted and reloaded.
2. socket: CAn be a filesystem socket or a network socket.
3. device: A device unit is associated with a hardware device.
4. mount: A mount unit is a mount point definition in the filesystem. Similar to an etry at `/etc/fstab`
5. target: A target unit is a grouping of other units, managet as a single unit.

The main command for controlling systemd units is `systemctl`

The most common systemctl actions will be:

1. systemctl start unit.service
2. systemctl stop unit.service
3. systemctl restart unit.service
4. systemctl status unit.service
5. systemctl is-active unit.service: show `active` if unit is running. Shows inactive otherwise
6. systemctl enable unit.service: unit will load during system initialization
7. systemctl disable unit.service: service won't start up at system initialization
8. systemctrl is-enabled unit.service: verifies whether unit starts with the system


The systemctl command can also control system targets. The multi-user.target unit combines all units required by the multi-user system environment.

Another way to change the default target is to modify the symbolic link `/etc/systemd/system/default.target` so it points to the desired target. The redefinition of the link can be done with the `systemctl` command by itself:

```
systemctl set-default multi-user.target
```

Get what's the system's default boot target.

```bash
systemctl get-default
```



- The configuration files associated with every unit: `/lib/systemd/system/`
- Command `systemctl list-unit-files`
- `systemctl list-unit-files --type=service` and `systemctl list-unit-files --type=target`
- systemctl list-units


Systemd is also responsible for triggering and responding to power related events.
1. systemctl suspend
2. systemctl hibernate


### Upstart

The initialization scripts used by Upstart are located in the directory /etc/init/. System services
can be listed with command initctl list, which also shows the current state of the services and, if
available, their PID number.



### Shutdown and Restart

`shutdown` acts as an intermediary to SysV or systemd procedures.
It executes the requested action by calling the corresponding action in the services manager adopted by the system.

After executing `shutdown`, all processes receive the `SIGTERM` signal followed by the `SIGKILL` signal. By default, the system alternates to runlevel 1. To change the default options for shutdown, the command should be executed with the following syntax:

```
$ shutdown [option] time [message]
```


the time part:
- hh:mm
- +m
- how or +0
