# 102.1 Design hard disk layout

Key knowledge areas
- Allocate filesystems and swap space to separate partitions or disks
- Tailor the design to the intended use of the system
- Ensure the /boot partition conforms to the hardware architecture requirements for booting.
- Knowledge of basic features of LVM

**To succeed in this objective: understand relationship between disks, partitions, filesystems and volumes**


Before a disk can be used by a computer it needs to be partitioned.
- A partition is a logical subset of the physical disk, like a logical "fence".
- Every disk needs at least one partition.
- Inside each partition there is a filesystem.

Partitions CANNOT span multiple disks. 
- LVM - Logical Volume Manager can be used to combine multiple partitions, even across disks, to form a single logical volume.
- Logical volumes abstract the limitations of the physical device and let your work with "pools" of disk space that can be combined or distributed in a much more flexible way than traditional partitions.


### Mount Points
Before a filesystem can be accessed, it needs to be mounted.
- Mount means attaching the filesystem to a specific point in your system's directory tree, called a `mount point`.
- When mounted, the contents of the filesystem will be available under the mount point.
- Imagine you have a partition with your user's personal data containing the directories `/carlos`, `/erika`. 
- When mounted under `/home`, the contents of those directories will be available under `/home/carlos`, `/home/erika`.
- You cannot mount a partition under `/mnt/userdata` if this directory does not exist.
- If the directory does exist and contain files, those files will be unavailable until you unmount the filesystem.

Traditionally, `/mnt` was the directory under which all external devices would be mounted
A number of pre-configured anchor points used to exist under it like: `/mnt/floppy`, `/mnt/cdrom`
This has been superseded by `/media`, which is now the default mount point for any user-removable media.
- Nowadays, removable devices are automatically mounted under `/media/USER/LABEL`.

-  Whenever you need to manually mount a filesystem, it is good practice to mount it under `/mnt` 

### Keeping Things Separated

By keeping bootloader-related files (stored on /boot) on a boot partition, you ensure your system will still be able to boot in case of a crash on the root filesystem.
Keeping user's personal directories (under /home) on a separate partition makes it easier to reinstall the system without the risk of accidentally touching user data.
